h) PAM Error
I eventually figured it out my self, with the help of some new Google results, so hopefully this post at least helps someone. It turns out that my /etc/pam.d/cups file was outdated. I deleted it and re-emerged cups and pam. For the record it currently reads 

Code:

# File autogenerated by pamd_mimic_system in pam eclass
